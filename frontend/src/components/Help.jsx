            1. Generate Key Pair
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - You can either <strong>paste an existing private or public key</strong> (in PKCS8 format) or choose to <strong>generate a new key pair</strong> with your specified settings.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - Select between 1024-bit or 2048-bit key sizes. Note: In this app, 2048-bit is considered more secure than 1024-bit.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - Click "Generate Key Pair" to create your new public and private keys, both formatted in PKCS8.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - Once generated or pasted, copy and save your keys securely as they are essential for your dataâ€™s security.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>
            2. Encrypt/Decrypt Messages
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - Select either Encrypt or Decrypt mode.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - For encryption: Enter your plaintext message and use the public key.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - For decryption: Enter your ciphertext in base64 format and use the private key.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - You can work with messages of any length and include special characters.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - Additionally, you have the option to attach or extract text from various files (Docs, PDFs, and TXT files) for encryption and decryption.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - The process utilizes OAEP padding with SHA-256 to securely handle data.
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>
            3. Manage Saved Ciphertexts
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - View and manage all your saved encrypted messages in one convenient location.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - Easily decrypt saved messages using your private key.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - Delete messages that are no longer needed.
